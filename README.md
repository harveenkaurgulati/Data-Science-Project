# NLP Project on Netflix Dataset
Hello, This is a natural language processing project on the Netflix Dataset. I have used different pre-processing techniques to understand which approach gives a better model performance. I have evaluated the performance of a range of models comparing Logistic Regression vs Naive Bayes Algorithm and then CNN vs DNN with different optimizers and settings. 
# Conclusion
The best model performance was achieved using the CNN model with an accuracy of approx. 77% with the Adam optimizer. Model trained with the stemming data preprocessing technique gave slightly better performance than the one trained on lemmatized data or with glove embeddings. Please view the conclusion section of the jupyter notebook for further insights.
