# NLP Project on Netflix Dataset
Hello, This is a natural language processing project on the Netflix Dataset. I have used different pre-processing techniques to understand which approach gives a better model performance. I have evaluated the performance of a range of models comparing Logistic Regression vs Naive Bayes Algorithm and then CNN vs DNN with different optimizers and settings.
